# 🧠 Health Risk Analysis

This project aims to predict whether individuals are at risk for chronic health conditions based on various medical and lifestyle parameters. It was developed as a **university-level machine learning project** by a team of five students.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Analyze health-related data to identify **risk indicators**
- Apply and compare **classification models** to predict health risk
- Improve model accuracy through **hyperparameter tuning**

---

## 👨‍💻 Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, lightgbm)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **CSV datasets**
- **Classification Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), LightGBM
- **Model tuning and evaluation**

## 🔍 Methodology

1. Data cleaning, handling missing values  
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and correlation study  
3. Training multiple classification models  
4. Hyperparameter tuning for performance improvement  
5. Model evaluation and comparison

## 📊 Model Results

| Model               | Accuracy (%) |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression| 80           |
| LightGBM           | 80           |
| SVM (before tuning)| 76           |
| SVM (after tuning) | 80           |

> 📌 Logistic Regression and LightGBM achieved the highest accuracy of **80%**.  
> 📌 SVM accuracy improved from **76% to 80%** after hyperparameter tuning.
